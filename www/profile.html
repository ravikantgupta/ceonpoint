                                        <p>When you complete one of our CE courses, you will receive a certificate of

                                            potential employers. &nbsp;Certificates of completion help demonstrate your
                                            accomplishments, and unfortunately, certificates are created using a
                                            template and the information provided by the CE Providers, thus there is no
                                            way to change the formatting for them.</p>
                                        <p>Please take into account that CEonpoint is not an accredited educative
                                            institution, and as a result, the certificate is issued not by the ceonpoint
                                            but by the CE Provider who are accredited educative institution and thus

                                            during your registration, henceforth it is important to use your full and
                                            complete name when registering your account details. If you indicated your
                                            incomplete name, you may be able to update it on your account, but sometimes
                                            you will need to contact our customer support team for update of your

                                        <p>Also, most of our certificate will be generated using the language selected
                                            for your account.&nbsp; As a general rule, the language will be English, and

                                        <p>We rely on authorized third-party payment processors in order to bill you
                                            through a payment account linked to your account.&nbsp; Depending on your
                                            location and what country your account is registered in, your payment
                                            methods may include the following: PayPal, international credit and debit
                                            cards such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.&nbsp; Cash
                                            payments via third party platforms and bank transfers may be an option for
                                            students in several different Latin American nations, as well as some
                                            countries in Europe and Asia.</p>
                                        <p>For users of our App, we also accept Apple App Store and Google Play.
                                            &nbsp;Since the mobile apps use Apple’s and Google’s payment systems,
                                            additional payment options may be available. </p>
                                        <p>Henceforth you hereby authorize us to charge the pertinent fees through your
                                            indicated payment processing account.&nbsp; CEonpoint shall not be held
                                            responsible for any and all costs, charges and currency conversion fees by
                                            the payment processor, and you should review its terms and policies from
                                            time to time, which will govern the provision of services to you.</p>
                                        <p>You must provide us with valid and current billing information.&nbsp; Except
                                            as expressly set forth herein, all payment charges are final and
                                            non-cancelable.&nbsp; If we detect any chargeback or if any payment is not
                                            received by us or our payment processors for any reason, you will promptly
                                            pay us any and all amounts due to us upon notice.&nbsp; Any failure or
                                            inability by us to process any payment hereunder does not relieve you from

                                        <p>Some of the most common reasons banks decline payments include insufficient
                                            funds, too many payment intents, card purchase limitations, and card
                                            security policies, among other issues. &nbsp;Since CEonpoint does not have
                                            detailed insights into why a payment is declined, we recommend contacting
                                            your payment processor or financial institution directly to help solve the
                                            payment issue.</p>

                                            to their account will see prices set in USD.&nbsp; We may accept other

                                            allowed by your payment processor.&nbsp; The currency is generally set based
                                            on the IP location of where your account was created.</p>
                                        <p>Due to compliance requirements, we are not permitted to change the currency

                                            CE Providers to upload top quality content, and we also allow our students
                                            to be able to request a refund if they are not satisfied with their

                                            the Site is for 30 days only.</p>
                                        <p>Since payments are sent to CE Providers after 30 days, for your protection we

                                        <p><u>Authority of Arbitrator</u>.&nbsp; If arbitration is initiated, the
                                            arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
                                            CEonpoint, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters
                                            or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the
                                            authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The
                                            arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
                                            any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                                            applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.</p>
                                        <p>The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
                                            describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
                                            based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has
                                            the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a
                                            court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding

                                            order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.</p>
                                        <p><u>Courts</u>. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement
                                            permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit

                                            future class or representative action or similar proceeding.&nbsp; Unless
                                            otherwise agreed by you and CEonpoint, you may not adjoin or consolidate any
